first 
This program is a program to get a link to the images needed for Instagram.

First find all the client's images in Instagram and download everything with the link.

The downloaded image is then processed and generated as many images as the user wants, but with different hash values.

The default is 1000, which creates 1000 different images for each image.

Then upload all of those images to https://imgbox.com to share them online and get the link.

the result file is imgsurls.txt



$python setup.py install
$python scraper.py [client name] -limit=1500(default=1000)



Please use freely.

And hope the development and cooperation of the code.
